# J.A.R.V.I.S

Personal_Assistant

## Description:

If you have ever watched the Iron Man movie, I’m damn sure that you must have considered yourself the boss of J.A.R.V.I.S.
Well, in reality, is it possible?
Definitely yes, It’s possible.
Inspired by it, here I have created my Personal_Assistant often named J.A.R.V.I.S which has similar essential functions to Alexa, Google nest, etc.

## What it does do?
In its Initial stage, it performs the following functions
Like:

•	Extract and speaks data from Wikipedia. (you can refer to the related pics.)

•	Opens YouTube, Google, Cmd, Stackoverflow, Calender. 

•	Plays music.

•	Tells the current time.

In its Second stage, of development, I have added the face lock, obviously from a security point of view. (As you can refer to the related pics with the user name and its recognition accuracy.) 

In the Third stage, of its development further, I will create its user interface.
 As in this project, the add-ons to it are unlimited. Step by step I will keep adding new features to make it more advanced.
